The [Z-counting method]({filename}../projects/zcounting.md) is a novel method for measuring instantaneous luminosity in proton–proton collisions using reconstructed Z → ℓ⁺ℓ⁻  decays.
By counting electron and muon pairs from Z bosons and applying data-driven corrections,
the approach achieves 2–4% precision over short timescales and shows excellent agreement with the standard ATLAS luminosity measurements.
This technique offers a reliable, independent cross-check for ATLAS luminosity monitoring.

# 2025
[LDPE]({filename}../projects/cllm.md) is a method of constraining the output length of decoder-only LLMs by introducing a countdown-style positional encoding.
This is introduced as an additional sinusoidal embedding which can be finetuned alongside existing embeddings with a small QA dataset for any foundation model.
Results show that this method is extremely effective and is a very low cost way to introduce strict length requirements for generated outputs.
