# 2021
The [Z-counting method]({filename}../projects/zcounting.md) is a novel method for measuring instantaneous luminosity in proton–proton collisions using reconstructed Z → ℓ⁺ℓ⁻  decays.
By counting electron and muon pairs from Z bosons and applying data-driven corrections,
the approach achieves 2–4% precision over short timescales and shows excellent agreement with the standard ATLAS luminosity measurements.
This technique offers a reliable, independent cross-check for ATLAS luminosity monitoring.
